In fact many new companies, as many as 30, have jumped in on this market in the hope of leveraging the growing needs of back-end integration and core developer requirements.&nbsp; While important for a developer looking to build a mobile app, not complete for an enterprise-grade deployment.&nbsp; Many of these companies provide nice integration features but fall short when it comes to scale, security and management and are designed for the developer, rather than the enterprise and the employee.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Few have the clout as &lsquo;enterprise grade&rsquo; where access to a company&rsquo;s existing APIs for elements such as encryption, caching and user management is required and to cloud services to share, store and sync content. FeedHenry delivers a competitive Mobile Application Platform that &nbsp;was born cloud &ndash; it is built on open standards with the latest technologies and as a result has no proprietary lock-in.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the beginning the company has focused its development on the enterprise customer and while the company delivers key enterprise grade MBaaS functionality, it is only a small portion of its platform offering.&nbsp; FeedHenry achieves key enterprise grade security and&nbsp; scalability for enterprise customers to handle a large number of transactions.&nbsp; The platform is deployed via multiple cloud options including private, public or hybrid and also enables cloud-based build farms to develop applications across iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry apps.&nbsp; In addition, FeedHenry delivers functionality such as mobile application management, mobile private app stores, remote data wipe and reporting and analytics not offered by stand-alone MBaaS providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So choose your name and be sure that MBaaS is part of it but as a business make certain that the offering is enterprise-grade in choosing a robust Mobile Application Platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n","contentHash":"d444d2e98689da806a2ca8305b163c4ddc71fc03","description":"FeedHenry Delivers an Enterprise-Grade Mobile Application Platform Including Robust MBaaS Functionality.

I&rsquo;ve seen hundreds &ndash; many fresh out of college, and some who&rsquo;ve spent years in industry.

Here&rsquo;s some general advice that doesn&rsquo;t apply&nbsp;specifically&nbsp;to FeedHenry &ndash; in fact, it should help in applying to any startup.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your cover letter, to me at least, isn&rsquo;t all that important. I&rsquo;ll probably read two paragraphs worth, and I&rsquo;m much more likely to read it if it&rsquo;s in the body of the email rather than in a separate document. This may horrify your careers advisor, but end the email like you&rsquo;d end any other &nbsp;- skip the &ldquo;Yours sincerely&rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now for the important stuff &ndash; the CV. A PDF gets some bonus points &ndash; nobody likes having to open Microsoft Word, and there&rsquo;s a chance some won&rsquo;t have it installed at all. A typical CV gets about &lt;strong&gt;30 seconds &lt;/strong&gt;attention. That&rsquo;s 20 seconds on the first page, a further 10 on the next. This first pass is crucial &ndash; if I&rsquo;m still interested, I&rsquo;ll then start to read in more detail.&lt;br /&gt;\nUnless you&rsquo;ve racked up a lot of industry experience, you shouldn&rsquo;t have any more than &lt;strong&gt;two pages&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not only is the content important, so is the order. I don&rsquo;t always make it beyond the first page. Here&rsquo;s a rough list of what I&rsquo;m looking for, in order:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contact &amp; personal details&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;small&gt;(Including a &lt;strong&gt;Github&lt;/strong&gt; account &ndash; don&rsquo;t have one? Get to work, this is the single greatest value you can add..)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List your skills&lt;/strong&gt; &ndash; those you know best go first. Feel free to categorise by&nbsp;proficiency, e.g. &ldquo;Proficient in:&rdquo;, &ldquo;Knowledge of:&rdquo;, or indeed category &ndash; e.g. &ldquo;Programming languages&rdquo;, &ldquo;Frameworks&rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;List your &lt;strong&gt;personal projects&lt;/strong&gt;. These are projects you&rsquo;ve done in your spare time, not as part of professional work or college coursework. &lt;strong&gt;Haven&rsquo;t got any? I&rsquo;ve probably stopped reading.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;List your relevant industry experience. This doesn&rsquo;t include that job as a Service Station Attendant 6 years ago where you learnt about&nbsp;responsibility. Don&rsquo;t care.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 16px;&quot;&gt;This post quickly reverted to bullets. Your CV should do the same.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following these steps won&rsquo;t work for every company, but for any self-respecting startup, these steps should raise your chances of at least getting to the interview stage.

And business units, anxious to develop and release apps that satisfy an end user need, can easily build an app completely independent of IT, pulling authority away from IT to control how business data is being consumed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The shifting role of IT in this new, ultra-mobile, app-driven world is evident: rather than being the &lt;em&gt;gatekeeper&lt;/em&gt; to data, IT is becoming a &lt;em&gt;business enabler&lt;/em&gt;.

Yes, there are millions of apps now from gaming and social media to shopping and banking, and this explosion of data being consumed through mobile devices has had an impact on business. Not only from the commercial point of view, with companies offering products and services through their apps but also it has forced enterprises to look at the benefits of apps designed for employees to improve productivity and reduce costs. In many businesses this is now as important as is reaching customers via mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In parallel to this new mobile reality, companies around the world have been embracing cloud computing and the adoption of cloud based applications continues to grow. &nbsp;Rackspace as market leader in Infrastructure-as-a-Service has seen significant growth in the adoption of cloud computing thanks to the many benefits that cloud offers businesses &ndash; from having a pool of resources available on virtual servers and the cost savings these represent to the fact that the infrastructure is hosted and maintained without capital expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All of this brings us back to embracing the two single biggest world trends in Information Technology; mobile and cloud, especially for enterprise mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Enterprises that are looking to provide mobile access to their employees and/or partners (B2E and B2B) require access to systems already in the cloud &ndash; access to a number of backend systems such as CRMs, ERPs and other internal systems. This of course is slightly different when we talk about consumer apps (B2C), where the mobile app may require information to and from a small number of backend systems, for example a product catalog database or a payment system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the goal to have B2E, B2B or B2C enterprise mobile apps, there are challenges with making critical business information available to mobile users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Enterprise mobile app challenges:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h5&gt;Integration&lt;/h5&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Multiple backend systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Legacy systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cloud services&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h5&gt;Security&lt;/h5&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;VPNs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;LDAP&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Encryptions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h5&gt;Scalability&lt;/h5&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Going from a few users to thousands even millions for consumer apps&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Integrating with more systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Integrating with data warehouses&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More app features&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h5&gt;&nbsp;Multi-platform Devices&lt;/h5&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;iOS, iPhones and iPads&nbsp; versions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Android phones and tablets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Blackberries&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Windows phones&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h5&gt;Frequent updates&lt;/h5&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On backend systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On app user interface&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Push notifications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;App content changes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Online &ndash; Offline synchronization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h5&gt;&nbsp;Monitoring and Analytics&lt;/h5&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;APIs monitoring (endpoints)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Users downloads and access&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Resources performance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;FeedHenry&rsquo;s mobile application platform is an ideal solution to develop, integrate, deploy and manage enterprise apps, and offers organizations the ability to rapidly create complex enterprise apps that integrate with multiple backend systems and cloud services that covers all the challenges previously mentioned. Development teams must overcome all these challenges and deliver critical functionality quickly for multiple platforms and most importantly they have to connect in a secure way with all backend, third party and legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;FeedHenry&rsquo;s Mobile Application Platform on Rackspace infrastructure provides a development and hosting platform that extends Rackspace to the mobile app space. Rackspace, the market leader in Infrastructure-as-a-Service, provides a secure and scalable infrastructure environment with industry leading technical support. Their service is built upon an open standards approach that makes it a perfect match to host FeedHenry&rsquo;s platform on Public Managed clouds, Private clouds or Hybrid clouds&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FeedHenry Mobile Application Platform Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;FeedHenry&rsquo;s Mobile Application Platform offers an open and flexible environment with the following features:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedhenry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/platform_rackspace.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3731 alignleft&quot; title=&quot;platform_rackspace&quot; src=&quot;http://www.feedhenry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/platform_rackspace.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;567&quot; height=&quot;248&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Development &amp; Testing Studio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Allow developers to quickly and easily develop HTML5 and Hybrid apps that can be deployed to multiple devices or create native iOS and Android apps. Developers can design templates and toolkits to speed up build time and use many of the available client side and server side APIs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile Backend-as-a-Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Enables full access to cloud services such as storage, security, caching, server-side business logic, and data sync. Backend integration is made easier and more efficient with standards-based server-side code on FeedHenry&rsquo;s cloud based platform. No more mobile devices connecting directly to Enterprise backend systems posing risks to sensitive business data or re-building apps every time there is a change in the backend system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile App Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Provides the enterprise with the tools needed to manage all mobile enterprise apps in one place, for example, allows administrators to distribute apps via a private app store, manage users access by corporate Active Directory and/or LDAP access and allows external users access via OAuth access such as Google, Twitter, Linkedin and Yahoo. Other important feature includes remote data wipe to remove data in case of mobile device lost or employment termination.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Reporting and Analytics provides key insights in two areas: a) cloud app statistics about consumed resources, CPU utilized, endpoints performances and other cloud infrastructure performance of the different mobile apps and b) reporting on app usage such as number of downloads, app traffic, per platform, per location, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Server-side code can be deployed to different RackSpace cloud environments, offering organizations the flexibility to deploy apps in their chosen cloud infrastructure (Public, Private, Hybrid) or choice of PaaS environment. If the Enterprise already uses a Platform-as-a-Service with Rackspace infrastructure, FeedHenry&rsquo;s platform provides the ability to deploy the server-side code and associated cache to any Cloud Foundry based PaaS (whether on-premise or elsewhere), opening up an emerging ecosystem of PaaS partners such as AppFog, ActiveState&rsquo;s Stackato, Tier3&rsquo;s IronFoundry and VMware.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Supports both on device and backend encryption, user authentication and authorization at device, app and cloud level.&nbsp; FeedHenry&rsquo;s platform allows you to open end-points securely to FeedHenry server-side requests with 128 or 256 bit encryption using AES or RSA algorithms as well as auditing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalable Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the app features, number of integrations and user base grows FeedHenry&rsquo;s platform is designed with the flexibility to scale up cloud resources without re-engineering the app or cloud integrations.&nbsp; Our platform is based on node.js technology that uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Build Farm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Deploy app-store ready apps using your own developer credential but without the need to maintain native development environment, for example, you can create iOS apps without a Mac because the FeedHenry platform has multiple build farms on the cloud for the different platforms (iOS, Android, Blackberry, etc.) and takes care of all the wrapping, creating the binaries that are then ready for each mobile device and version.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In summary enterprises can benefit from a mobile app platform that offers maximum flexibility and scalability, ease of integration with backend systems, rapid deployment, light-weight apps due useful functions on the server-side code and the ability to choose from a variety of cloud configurations for cost effective storage and security.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Request a demo through our Sales team at &nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sales@feedhenry.com&quot;&gt;sales@feedhenry.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp; or &nbsp;go to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedhenry.com&quot;&gt;www.feedhenry.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;for more information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n","contentHash":"021690da18ad431141cdf6bd5ff807b95d787299","description":"FeedHenry embraces the two single biggest world trends in Information Technology today; &nbsp;mobile apps and the cloud&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no secret that we live in the mobile era, all over the world smartphone market penetration keeps growing and in some countries tablets are selling more than desktop computers and laptops.&nbsp; Everything in the mobile industry [...]","entryGuid":"http://www.feedhenry.com/?p=3730","entryHash":"W95-ac1J8C3RMyLIii2KJ4Lm-http://www.feedhenry.com/2013/04/mobile-and-cloud-…paign=mobile-and-cloud-feedhenrys-mobile-application-platform-on-rackspace","feed":"W95-ac1J8C3RMyLIii2KJ4Lm","georssPoint":"","imageLinks":{},"link":"http://www.feedhenry.com/2013/04/mobile-and-cloud-feedhenrys-mobile-applica…paign=mobile-and-cloud-feedhenrys-mobile-application-platform-on-rackspace","lookupHash":"5f8755472f50771522c581ab5e0f1d586dceb956","publishedDate":"2013-04-09 18:23:00","reapOrder":8,"sysCreated":"2013-05-01 23:13:05:384","sysGroupFlags":65567,"sysGroupList":"","sysModified":"2013-08-07 18:31:02:865","sysShardPoint":2225176730,"sysVersion":117,"title":"Mobile and Cloud, FeedHenry’s Mobile Application Platform on Rackspace"},"guid":"W95-ajIlIWYFS67vdz7anx2-","type":"feed_Entry"},{"fields":{"author":"admin","category":"Enterprise,Node,cloudfoundry,MAP,Developer,HP,nodejs,MEAP","contentEncoded":"&lt;h4&gt;Mobile Apps Dominate yet Challenge the Enterprise&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A well-executed mobile app strategy results in improved employee efficiency, reduction in costs and the potential to increase customer engagement and revenue generation.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s not as simple as it seems. Enterprises face serious challenges, not only in keeping up with the demands to develop new and more complex apps but also in ensuring the security, scaling and management of those apps. Enterprises have turned to Mobile Application Platforms (MAP) as an end to end &nbsp;solution for the development, deployment, integration and management of these apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However to create&nbsp;truly&nbsp;effective apps, organizations need solutions that tie in to their cloud strategy, driving the need for a mobile app platform (MAP) that can deploy server-side code wherever the enterprise needs it, whether that&rsquo;s a public or private cloud. A successful MAP needs to offer maximum flexibility and ease of deployment to different cloud and PaaS environments. &nbsp;Then enterprise app developers can create, deploy and manage their apps on a secure and scalable platform without having to worry about cloud configuration, scaling, or lifetime management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Why do Enterprises favor a Mobile Application Platform approach?&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As enterprise mobility has matured, organizations are creating a growing number of apps that require integration with cloud, legacy and third party systems. Most importantly these disparate systems must be presented as a unified experience for the end user. Once the apps are shipped the organisation must then deal with &nbsp;with app management, security and scaling over the lifetime of the app deployment. &lt;strong&gt;Mobile apps have now been elevated from being a tactical marketing tool to being a strategic business initiative that needs to align with the overall business strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;FeedHenry addresses the need for a well integrated mobile and cloud strategy with their Mobile Application Platform. The FeedHenry platform supports an end to end lifecycle model that includes:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;app design and development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Secure connectivity via HTTPS and/or PKI infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Integration with back end systems via our proxy layer and Node.js business logic&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analytics insight on both client and server&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The platform is built on an Open Source stack that includes Phonegap, CloudFoundry, Mongo, Redis and MySQL. For client side development we support &nbsp;HTML5, Native SDKs and hybrid app development for all major mobile devices and form factors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most importantly we believe in a&nbsp;philosophy&nbsp;of &ldquo;any cloud&rdquo;. So we can host FeedHenry anywhere you can supply a suite of Linux instances, whether private, public or hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In FeedHenry you actually can have it your way &lt;img src='http://www.feedhenry.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FeedHenry Mobile Application Platform Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedhenry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/platform_architect.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-3549&quot; title=&quot;platform_architect&quot; src=&quot;http://www.feedhenry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/platform_architect.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;508&quot; height=&quot;223&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The hosted &lt;strong&gt;Mobile App Development and Testing&lt;/strong&gt; environment allows enterprises develop HTML5 and hybrid apps that can be deployed to multiple devices (iOS, Android, Blackberry, and Windows Phone) and mobile web in a &ldquo;build once, run everywhere&rdquo; fashion. But &nbsp;we don&rsquo;t have HTML5 religion, Developers are &nbsp;can use our native SDKs to build apps &ldquo;the hard way&rdquo; &lt;img src='http://www.feedhenry.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For Enterprises we offer a Mobile Application Management suite that allows them to distribute apps via a private app store, control access via logins control by corporate Active Directory and/or LDAP access and finally allows external users access via OAuth access such as that used by Google, Twitter, Linkedin and Yahoo. Once a user leaves the organisation we can wipe the data remotely for specific FeedHenry apps without interfering with the rest of the end-users data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The platform&rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Mobile Application Cloud&lt;/strong&gt; meets the critical needs of enterprise mobility. The mobile Backend-as-a-Service (mBaaS) enables full access to cloud services such as storage, security, caching, server-side business logic, and data syncing. Rather than the app on-device connecting directly to backend systems and posing risks to sensitive business data, it does so via the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; Mobile Proxy Layer&lt;/strong&gt; provides a hosted JavaScript Node.js layer with local caching.&nbsp; At its simplest this secures internal enterprise end-points, via a mobile proxy layer, avoiding the enterprise end-points being open to the Internet, and improves performance, by caching the results. &nbsp;However, the server-side can be much more complex if required, for example, transformation of XML into JSON, or other server-side business logic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A key feature of the FeedHenry platform is the ability to deploy this server-side JavaScript and its associated cache to any Cloud Foundry (CF) PaaS (whether on-premise or elsewhere), opening up an emerging ecosystem of CF PaaS partners such as HP Cloud&rsquo;s Application PaaS, AppFog, ActiveState&rsquo;s Stackato, Tier3&rsquo;s IronFoundry, DELL&rsquo;s Fast PaaS and VMware, the creator of CF.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This means that any public or private IaaS provider can be used, including VMware&rsquo;s vSphere, HP Cloud Services, Telef&oacute;nica Instant Servers, Joyent Cloud, Rackspace Cloud Servers and Apache AWS.&nbsp; Anywhere you can deploy a set of Cloud Foundry Virtual Machines (VMs) can become the staging target for your server-side code, managed by FeedHenry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, FeedHenry enables enterprise developers to deploy their server-side code to both public and private cloud and PaaS environments with a single click. The platform is also offered as a cloud service on HP Cloud at &lt;a href=&quot;https://hpcs.feedhenry.com/&quot;&gt;https://hpcs.feedhenry.com/&lt;/a&gt; and on public Cloud Foundry at &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobilecf.feedhenry.com/&quot;&gt;https://mobilecf.feedhenry.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n","contentHash":"949512ed2b5f8a52df3ff0a70d45f5bcc0bd2f24","description":"Mobile Apps Dominate yet Challenge the Enterprise A well-executed mobile app strategy results in improved employee efficiency, reduction in costs and the potential to increase customer engagement and revenue generation.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s not as simple as it seems.

This post attempts to bring together all these features and tweaks that the Apps team here at FeedHenry use on a daily basis to build apps like a power user.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;FHC&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first tool of choice is our Command Line Interface (CLI). FHC allows you to list, create, build and deploy applications in FeedHenry from the command line. Why is this a power user feature? Most power users prefer to be able to perform tasks through a few keystrokes on a command line, rather than through a visual UI. Here are a few popular use cases for FHC:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A SCM system that doesn&rsquo;t support post receive hooks to automatically pull code after a checkin?\n&lt;pre&gt;fhc git pull someAppID&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Find yourself frequently creating a series of iPhone and Android builds for distribution Over The Air (OTA)? Build a shell script that kicks these builds off through FHC, come back once done&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Want to search through log output of an app in a live environment?\n&lt;pre&gt;fhc logs someAppID | grep -i 'ERROR: '&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Need to quickly apply a hotfix?\n&lt;pre&gt;git push origin release\nfhc git pull someAppID\nfhc stage someAppID --live&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Aliases&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To make the use of FHC more useful, we make use of aliases. The ID assigned to an app is really long &ndash; and while we can copy and paste, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to alias it to something else. Setting up an alias is simple:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;fhc alias myapp=sX7ITIjMxxLiZllZi0rRWHrM&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, we can run commands like&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;fhc logs myapp&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Working Locally&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Another very useful power user feature of FHC is &lt;em&gt;fhc local&lt;/em&gt;. Local allows developers to work on their app offline.&nbsp;To get set up for working locally, we first need to install dependencies, as you would with any Node.js application. To do this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;cd cloud\nnpm install -d\ncd ..&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, we&rsquo;re good to go. We simply run&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;fhc local&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and open http://127.0.0.1:8888 (localhost) in our web browser. What this does in the background is runs the &lt;em&gt;main.js &lt;/em&gt;cloud code&nbsp;from your cloud directory locally as a Node.js process, and also runs a webserver serving up the files in client/default/index.html.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There&rsquo;s many options available too, such as watching the local file system for changes, proxying requests through to the FeedHenry live environment rather than running the app locally and applying packages. To see all the options available, run&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;fhc local --help&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Using Over The Air (OTA)&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;OTA makes installing builds on device much quicker. This feature is available for all Android developers, but only those in possession of an iOS Enterprise Development account ($299/yr rather than $99/yr) can sign apps Over The Air. To do this, you need to use a Distribution Certificate &amp; Private Key, along with an In-House provisioning profile. Once these resources are uploaded to your account, you can use &lt;em&gt;fhc ota&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;to generate OTA builds, and builds in the studio will also show an OTA install URl.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Using Git&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a team-based environment, using some form of SCM is vital to the success of the project. We use git.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Usually, we&rsquo;ll have sprint branches, where the user stories for that sprint are checked in. All developers work off this sprint. Developers will develop and test code locally using &lt;em&gt;fhc local&lt;/em&gt; (described above), and once done commit it to the repository.&lt;br /&gt;\nTo make sure we don&rsquo;t need to &lt;em&gt;git pull&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;our app&nbsp;every time, we use a post receive hook &ndash; this tells FeedHenry to grab the latest code on every commit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Releases are done off either &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; or, more than likely, a &lt;em&gt;release&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;branch. The reason for using a release branch rather than master is it&rsquo;s too easy to accidentally check into &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;\nWe have a corresponding FeedHenry studio app for &lsquo;dev&rsquo; and &lsquo;release&rsquo; &ndash; one of which points to the latest sprint branch, the other the release branch. When we&rsquo;re ready to ship new code, the sprint branch gets merged into release. We then stage the cloud code, and generate builds, both from the live project in FeedHenry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Screencast&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some of these points are illustrated in our screencast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/48370607&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-3306 alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Video on Vimeo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.feedhenry.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screen-Shot-2012-08-31-at-00.22.07.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;469&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n","contentHash":"c22e01c3c92f2f96ce2ac21b9416887866ce1df2","description":"If you&rsquo;ve used the FeedHenry platform to develop mobile apps, chances are you&rsquo;ve gotten to grips with some of our power user features.
